        This application was built as a demonstration of how <span className="font-bold"> React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS</span> can be combined to create a dynamic and fully themeable experience. It features <span className="font-bold">three completely different UI themes</span> â€” from a clean minimalist design to a rich dark sidebar layout and a colorful, playful grid.
